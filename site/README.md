# Assistant Manager Site

This example shows a minimal offline-capable website for creating and viewing "assistants". It uses Python's built-in `http.server` module so no external dependencies are required.

## Running

```
python3 site/server.py
```

The server listens on port 8000. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to use the dashboard and create assistants.
