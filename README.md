# OpenAI Assistant Manager

This repository contains a small demo website for managing OpenAI-style assistants without any external Python dependencies. The site now supports user registration, login/logout, password changes and a simple dashboard for creating, editing and deleting assistant entries. The dashboard includes a search box to quickly filter assistants by name or description. Styling is handled with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for a modern look and optional info messages after each action. All code is located in the `site/` directory.

See `site/README.md` for instructions on running the server.
